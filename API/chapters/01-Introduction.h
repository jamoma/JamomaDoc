	@mainpage 01. A non-exhaustive introduction to the Jamoma platform
	
	@author Jamoma, Timothy Place

	The Jamoma Platform is composed of a layered framework architecture that creates an object model 
	and then specializes that object model for advanced purposes such as audio and graphics.

	- Foundation : Runtime and API implementing a light-weight, dynamically bound, reflective object-oriented architecture layer on top of C++
	- DSP : A C++ framework for audio processing objects
	- Graph : A coding layer for the creation of dynamic asynchronous graph topographies
	- Audio Graph : A coding layer for the creation of dynamic audio graph topographies
	- Graphics : A Cairo-based graphics system build on the Jamoma Foundation API
	- Modular : A modular framework for patching in Max
	- Ruby : Jamoma Ruby - Language Bindings for the Jamoma Platform
	- Test : Automated unit test system for Jamoma
	- Tools : Tools and Utilities for the Development and Distribution of Jamoma
